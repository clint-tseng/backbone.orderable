h1. backbone.orderable "!https://secure.travis-ci.org/clint-tseng/backbone.orderable.png!":http://travis-ci.org/clint-tseng/backbone.orderable

A basic implementation for an idiom wherein the ordering of a collection is both significant and user-defined.

h2. Backbone.OrderableCollection

Adds a method @move(model, idx)@ which moves the specified model to the given index of the models array. It will bail if the given model is not actually in the collection already.

It will, on these occasions, fire a @move@ event on the collection with the parameters @model, idx@.

h2. Backbone.OrderableView

Provides a somewhat-opinionated basic view that handles automatic rendering and removal of models on @add@ and @remove@, as well as handles external @move@ events on the collection. Assumes models go directly within the collection DOM element; if this is not the case then @_addOneView@ and @_move@ should both be overriden with custom implementation.

h2. example

An example implementation using my own "awesomereorder":https://github.com/clint-tseng/awesomereorder jQuery plugin can be found in the @examples/@ directory. That example can be found on the web "here":http://selene.antinod.es/dev/backbone.orderable/example/index.html .
